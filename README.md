# quadratic-equation-solver-neuralnet
This notebook shows how to train a neural network to solve equations of the form ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 where 0 &leq; a, b, c < 1 

## Getting Started

The train.ipynb has the all you need to generate the synthetic training data, train and run the model. All you need to do is to meet the prerequisites. 

### Prerequisites

Python>=3.8.6

```
numpy 
tensorflow 
```

### Training
Run the jupyter notebook cells in [train.ipynb](https://github.com/FrederickRoman/quadratic-equation-solver-neuralnet/blob/main/train.ipynb).
